# Project Codename: AI Hub
"Empower Your Computer, Unleash Your Potential"

## Introduction
AI Hub is the nexus of personal computing: a single, persistent AI assistant interface designed to streamline your interactions with your computer. By providing a central "face" to the multitude of processes and applications you use daily, AI Hub seeks to enhance productivity and simplify your digital experience.
AI Hub is a new visual framwork for AI Assitents based on the OpenAI Assistents API.

## How AI Hub Works

The AI Hub is structured to host a variety of specialized AI assistants, each with unique capabilities and knowledge bases. The architecture is straightforward:

- Each assistant has a `.py` script dedicated to its "main" functions. Initially, these scripts contain all the functions available to that particular assistant.
- Functions are exclusive to one assistant to minimize code duplication and restrict access. Shared functions are placed in a "common knowledge" file to encourage communication between assistants.
- The primary communication method between assistants is email, which facilitates a log of interactions and an accessible format for collaboration.
- Assistants schedule meetings with each other and the user, enabling direct involvement and oversight of the AI's operations and decisions.
- The "Work" assistant is particularly focused on ensuring a healthy work-life balance, scheduling work efficiently while protecting personal time and well-being.

## Features
### Chapter 1: The Interface
- **Minimalist Design**: A simple window with a dynamic circle animation representing the AI, embodying the assistant's current status and activity.
- **Interactive Controls**: One button to command, one text box to communicate, and one display area for the AI's responses and visual data presentations.
- **Integration**: Designed to seamlessly integrate with all PC software and online services.

### Chapter 2: The Core
- **Python-Powered**: Built with the simplicity and power of Python, utilizing Toga for a cross-platform GUI experience.
- **Server Capability**: Engineered for future deployment on servers, facilitating inter-AI communication and collaborative processing.

### Chapter 3: Expansion and Adaptability
- **Modular Design**: Crafted for expandability, allowing for new features and integrations as the project grows.
- **Open Development**: Inviting contributions and suggestions from the community to evolve the AI assistant.
